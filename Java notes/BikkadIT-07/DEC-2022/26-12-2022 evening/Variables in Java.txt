Variable: Variable is the name of memeory location.
It is userdefinied name given by user.
varibles can store any type of value.

Types of Variables:

1)Local Variable.
2)Instance Variable.
3)Static Variable.

1) Local Variable: A variable which is declared inside 
body of method is called as local variable.


Example :

package variable;

public class LocalVariable {

	public void show() {

		int a = 50;
		System.out.println(a);

	}

	public static void main(String[] args) {

		LocalVariable lc = new LocalVariable();
		lc.show();
	}
}





2) Instance Variable: A variable which is declared inside body of class and outside method is 
 called as Instance variable.

Example :

package variable;

public class InstanceVariable {

	int a = 40;

	public void show() {

		System.out.println(a);

	}

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		InstanceVariable iv=new InstanceVariable();
		iv.show();
		System.out.println(iv.a);
		
	}
}



3) static variable: A variable which is declared inside class and outside the method
 with the help of static keyword.

Example :

package variable;

public class InstanceVariable {

	static int a = 40;

	public void show() {

	}

	public static void main(String[] args) {
	
		System.out.println(InstanceVariable.a);
		
	}
}



Example : INstace variables we can can access only in non static area but static variables 
   we can access in static and non static area.

package variable;

public class InstanceVariable {

	static int s = 40;
    int i=90;
	public void show() {
		System.out.println(i);
		System.out.println(s);
	}

	public static void display() {
       System.out.println(s);
     //  System.out.println(i);
	}

	public static void main(String[] args) {

		InstanceVariable iv=new InstanceVariable();
		iv.show();
		
		InstanceVariable.display();
		
		

	}
}

















Diffrence Between instance variable and static variable:

1)Instance variables are declared in a class, but outside a method, constructor or any block.

2)static variables also known as Class variables are declared with the static keyword in a class, 
but outside a method, constructor or a block.

2) Instance variables are created when an object is created with the use of 
the keyword 'new' and destroyed when the object is destroyed.

2)Static variables are created when the program starts and destroyed when the program stops.

3)Instance variables we can call by using object referance.

3)Static variables can be accessed by calling with the class name ClassName.VariableName.
